Title:
SIP calculator

Overview Of the project

In today's financial world, Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are a popular option for building wealth over time. However, figuring out compound interest with monthly contributions and seeing the growth can be tricky for most users. This project, the SIP Calculator & Visualizer, is a Python application that aims to make financial planning easier. It takes user inputs on investment amounts and expected returns, applies standard compounding formulas, and gives both a numerical summary and a visual graph of wealth growth over time.

Features

Precise Financial Calculation: Accurately calculates the Maturity Amount, Total Investment, and Wealth Gained (Interest) based on monthly inputs.

Visual Growth Tracking: Generates a dynamic line graph using Matplotlib to visualize how the investment grows month-by-month over the selected tenure.

Real-Time Reporting: Generates a timestamped calculation report, providing an instant summary of the investment plan.

Compound Interest Logic: Uses the geometric monthly rate formula to ensure high precision in return calculations, rather than simple averages.

Input Validation: Includes error handling to manage edge cases, such as 0% interest rates or invalid negative inputs.
