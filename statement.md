Problem Statement


Many investors struggle to accurately estimate the long-term growth of their Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) due to the complexity of compound interest calculations. Furthermore, without visual aids, it is difficult to perceive how consistent monthly contributions accumulate into substantial wealth over time. This project solves this challenge by providing a precise Python-based tool that automates financial projections and generates dynamic growth graphs, empowering users to visualize their wealth trajectory and make informed investment decision


Scope of the project


The scope of this project is to develop a precision-based financial analysis tool for evaluating Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). It focuses on implementing accurate compound interest algorithms to compute maturity values, total investment, and accrued interest. Beyond numerical analysis, the project extends to data visualization, utilizing Matplotlib to render dynamic growth charts that illustrate the power of compounding over time. The current scope is designed for personal financial planning, providing a console-based interface to simulate various investment scenarios and visualize long-term wealth accumulation.


Target Users


1.Personal Investors: Individuals looking for a precise, data-driven tool to estimate the future value of their monthly savings.

2. Financial Enthusiasts: Users who want to visualize their wealth growth trajectory through dynamic graphs rather than just static numbers.

3. Students & Python Learners: Developers seeking a practical example of how to combine financial algorithms with Matplotlib visualizations.


High Level Features


1. Precision Compounding: Utilizes accurate geometric monthly rate formulas to calculate exact maturity values and total accrued interest.

2. Dynamic Visualization: Integrates Matplotlib to generate real-time growth charts, allowing users to visualize their wealth accumulation month-by-month.

3. Comprehensive Reporting: Outputs a timestamped financial summary that breaks down total investment versus profit gained.

4. Robust Input Handling: Includes validation logic to manage edge cases like zero-interest scenarios or invalid negative inputs.
