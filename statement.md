Problem Statement

Many investors struggle to accurately estimate the long-term growth of their Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) due to the complexity of compound interest calculations. Furthermore, without visual aids, it is difficult to perceive how consistent monthly contributions accumulate into substantial wealth over time. This project solves this challenge by providing a precise Python-based tool that automates financial projections and generates dynamic growth graphs, empowering users to visualize their wealth trajectory and make informed investment decision

Scope of the project

The scope of this project is to develop a precision-based financial analysis tool for evaluating Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). It focuses on implementing accurate compound interest algorithms to compute maturity values, total investment, and accrued interest. Beyond numerical analysis, the project extends to data visualization, utilizing Matplotlib to render dynamic growth charts that illustrate the power of compounding over time. The current scope is designed for personal financial planning, providing a console-based interface to simulate various investment scenarios and visualize long-term wealth accumulation.
